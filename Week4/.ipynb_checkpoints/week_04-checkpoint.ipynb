    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting familiar with functions and recursion\n",
    "- Working with file I/O and the CSV format\n",
    "- Consolidating the use of variables and flow control statements\n",
    "- Getting familiar with the basics of cryptography\n",
    "- Using basic cryptography algorithms available in Python\n",

    "Welcome to the world of Alice and Bob! A magical land in which the sole worry of its noble habitats, Alice and Bob, is the sending and receiving of messages in a safe and secure fashion, and in whose dark corners lurk villains ready to intercept messages.\n",

    "Your task in the following is to follow Alice and Bob in their intellectual journey in achieving privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To flesh things out, Alice and Bob want to send each other messages but do not want anyone else to find out what their contents are. How can they achieve such a feat?\n",

    "## Symmetric encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "One answer is that Alice could create a *secret key* and *lock* her messages using that key. This is called symmetric encryption.\n",

    "Note that *how* we create the secret key and *how* we lock the messages are beyond the scope of this tutorial, and, therefore, we will delegate those details to available implementations.

Nevertheless, the inner workings of such algorithms are outside the scope of this document, see this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have worked it out yourself, the existence of a key pair as described above largely solves Alice and Bob's problem. If you have not figured it out yet, take a moment and see if you can find a way for them to exchange secret messages securely using the presented scheme.\n",

Now Alice is able to encrypt a secret message using Bob's public key and only Bob is able to decrypt the message using his private key. Vise versa, Bob can encrypt a message using Alice's public key and only Alice can gain access to it using her private key. Note that it is unimportant if third parties gain access to the public keys as they cannot be used to decrypt messages encrypted with the public keys.\n",

In particular, symmetric cryptography is often used to encrypt the actual data to be encrypted, which can be large, while asymmetric cryptography is used to encrypt only the symmetric key, which is limited in size.\n",
