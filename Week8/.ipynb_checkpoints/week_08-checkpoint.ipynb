    "# WEEK 07 - OO Programming I\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting started with object-oriented programming\n",
    "- Consolidating procedural programming concepts and employing them in the context of object-oriented design\n",
    "- Learning about object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.\n",
    "- Learning about good practices and pitfalls in object-oriented design\n",
    "- Understanding and implementing basic concepts from complex analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following set of tutorials, we are going to embark on a journey that will take us from complex analysis to sparse matrices and graph theory, and through which you will hopefully consolidate the concepts from procedural programming and employ them in a new and exciting way that is object-oriented programming. In particular, we are going to see how the idea of objected-oriented programming is useful for the implementation of various scientific concepts, and will learn about good practices and pitfalls of object-oriented design and concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complex analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start by implementing an object-oriented representation of complex numbers. Complex numbers $\\mathbb{C}$ extend the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with $i$, called the imaginary unit and satisfying $i^{2} = -1$. Every complex number $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ can be represented as $z = \\alpha + \\beta i$, where $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. $\\alpha$ is referred to as the *real* part and $\\beta$ as the *imaginary* part. Note that all real numbers can be represented as a complex number whose imaginary part is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since complex numbers consist of two parts, it is often useful to visualize them on the 2D plain, with the $x$ axis typically representing the real part and the $y$ axis representing the imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the complex number $z = 2 + i$ can be visualized as follows:"

    "\n",
    "### Basic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers can be added together and subtracted from each other by simply adding and subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately as follows:\n",

    "Let $x = \\alpha_{1} + \\beta_{1}i$ and $y = \\alpha_{2} + \\beta_{2}i$\n",

    "z = x - y := (\\alpha_{1} - \\alpha_{2}) + (\\beta_{1} - \\beta_{2})i.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication operator can then be defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that complex multiplication corresponds to a scaling and rotation operation geometrically, which I personally find beautiful. It is furthermore the reason behind why Euler's formula $e^{ix} = cos(x) + sin(x)i$ holds, why multiplication by a point on the unit circle is pure rotation and why $e^{ix}$ corresponds to rotation around the unit circle about the origin!\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we are going to define the conjugate of $z = \\alpha + \\beta i$ as $\\bar{z} = \\alpha - \\beta i$, which geometrically corresponds to reflection about the real axis as illustrated below:"

In particular, we would like to define the notion of complex numbers as well as the basic operators above in Python such that complex computations become possible. Our design should fulfill the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The implementation should define complex numbers and support the following operators: summation, subtraction, multiplication, conjugation, computing the absolute value, visualization on the complex plain\n",
    "- It should be easy to reuse and combine these operators, e.g., adding two complex numbers should be as convenient as adding three or adding two complex number and then multiplying it with a third.\n",

    "## Sparse matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "You are all familiar with matrices as 2-dimensional algebraic objects consisting of rows and columns of numbers. We have even touched on the ever-so-important matrix-vector multiplication in the previous exercises. Here, I am going to tell you that these prototypical matrices are more rightfully called dense matrices and, as you may have guessed, are not the only type of matrices out in the wild!\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we are going to concern ourselves in this section with another type of matrix format, namely [sparse matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix), which, as opposed to dense matrices in the general case, consist mostly of zeros! As a matter of fact, that is the sole criterion that demarcates dense and sparse matrices. More formally, a sparse matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ of size $n \\times m$ is a matrix in which $\\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A}) \\ll n \\times m$, where $\\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A})$ denotes the number of non-zero entries in $\\mathbf{A}$, as illustrated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"figures/sparse_matrix.png\" width=\"300\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder why we would bother and what the point is. The answer is that in may scientific problems, sparse matrices⸺matrices consisting of mostly zeros⸺arise naturally, and the development and deployment of a specialized matrix format for such problems is motivated principally by the following optimization opportunities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The storage of the zero entries occupies unnecessary memory,\n",
    "- The zero entries lead to unnecessary computation in many matrix operations such as matrix-vector multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very well. Given the motivation above and the fact that these problems seem to be ubiquitous in scientific computing⸺you have to take my word on this⸺it seems reasonable to employ specialized **data structures** for such algebraic entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is how such a data structure should look like in order to properly exploit the underlying optimization opportunities. This is a question that I would like to encourage you to think about for a moment, namely given a matrix with mostly zero entries, can you come up with a data structure that will allow for its optimized storage and application?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the setting more clear, here are a few criteria that any potential data structure should satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sparse $n \\times m$ sparse matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, the data structure should\n",
    "\n",
    "- store $\\mathbf{A}$ in $O(\\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A}))$⸺Note how we are using the big $O$ notation to denote memory complexity much in the same fashion as we use it for computational complexity\n",
    "- provide access to any entry $a_{ij}, i = 1, \\dots, n, \\; j = 1, \\dots, m$\n",
    "- provide appropriate methods for the application of the matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate format\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple clever ways to construct a data structure for sparse matrices that range in complexity. Here, we are going to limit ourselves to perhaps the simplest possible data structure, which I believe is the first iteration in arriving at the more complex alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, the coordinate format represents all non-zero entries in $\\mathbf{A}$ along with their *coordinates*, i.e., indices, hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, given a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, the coordinate format stores $\\mathbf{A}$ using three vectors as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"figures/coordinate_format.png\" width=\"400\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ stores the non-zero elements of $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{i}_{k}$ and $\\mathbf{j}_{k}$ store the row and column indices of $\\mathbf{a}_{k}$, respectively such that $\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{i}_{k} \\: \\mathbf{j}_{k}} = \\mathbf{a}_{k}$. It should be noted that the length of the vectors $\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{i}$ and $\\mathbf{j}$ are $\\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A})$; therefore, the total storage cost of the coordinate format is $3 \\times \\text{nnz}(\\mathbf{A})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the coordinate format could theoretically be used also for dense matrices; however, it would not carry any advantage in this case, and would in fact be vastly less efficient than typical dense-matrix representations. Can you reason why that is the case?\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to implement matrices in Python, both dense and sparse (coordinate format) and provide a set of functionalities, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- information regarding the size of the matrix\n",
    "- access to any entry $a_{ij}, i = 1, \\dots, n, \\; j = 1, \\dots, m$\n",
    "- matrix-vector multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the same reasons as the previous part of this exercise concerning complex numbers, it is natural and beneficial to implement the coordinate format, and more generally, matrices as classes in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try and convince yourself that it is in fact the case, namely think about the following design criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data structure should provide a number of functionalities such as access to elements, matrix-vector multiplication, etc.\n",
    "- It should be possible to reuse and extend these functionalities easily\n",
    "- We would like to be able to hide implementation details from the end user⸺What is this design principle called?\n",
    "- We would like to prevent (at least in principle) users from making arbitrary changes to the state of the matrices without going through some predefined procedure⸺What is this design principle called?\n",
    "- We would like to be able to avoid code duplication as much as possible by reusing the shared part of the behavior between various matrix formats, but as the same time, be able to retain specialized behavior for each format⸺How can this be achieved?\n",
    "- It should be possible to extend our implementation to other matrix formats in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "Give these questions a good thought before you continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the exercise more concrete, I am going to make some design choices in the following. Note that although the following is generally based on the best practices of object-oriented design, and I will reason some of my choices, it is **not** the only way to achieve the objectives above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that all matrices have some shared behavior and properties, e.g., size, application to vectors, etc., it seems to be a good idea to implement a **parent** class `Matrix` to encompass such behavior. Note that `Matrix` does not implement any particular matrix format."

Note that the generic matrix-vector multiplication above would work out of the box even for the coordinate format, even though it is a sparse matrix! (why?) Nevertheless, given that the main motivation behind sparse matrices is in principle the promise of efficiency, it is time to ask ourselves if we can do better. In other words, can we implement a *specialized* version of the matrix-vector multiplication for the coordinate format such that it performs better than the generic version? The answer is **yes**. It is your job to figure out how. **Hint**: note that during the matrix-vector operation, any zero entries in the matrix has no effect on the resultant vector.\n",

In particular, sparse matrices are supposed to increase efficiency by reducing the number of redundant operations. We are going to put this hypotheses to the test in the following. Namely, we would like to measure the runtime of matrix-vector multiplication for dense and coordinate format matrices of varying size and investigate whether sparse matrices perform better, and if yes, under what circumstances.
