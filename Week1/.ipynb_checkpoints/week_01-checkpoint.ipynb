    "What you see in front of you is a marvel of technology! Just as it is difficult to imagine how there is more computing power in a modern iPhone than there was in the Apollo 9 mission (!), the environment you are interacting with provides a colossal conglomerate of integrated functionalities and services to the developer that was difficult to imagine only a few years ago. And it is surprising to me how many people take this fact for granted!\n",

    "The JupyterLab environment is arguably the de facto leader in a new trend referred to as computational notebooks. In layman terms, a computational notebook is a document that combines code, text, and media into a single unit.\n",
