    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting started with loops and arrays\n",
    "- Consolidating the basics\n",
    "- Learning to use variables and control statements in more intricate combinations\n",
    "- Getting started with more complex tasks that involve multifaceted logic\n",
    "- Understanding scheduling and the different methods for distributing tasks\n",
    "- Understanding the basic implementation of vector-matrix multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to get started with programming more complicated tasks, which resemble more closely real-world problems. We are going to need control statements such as loops and conditional statements and data structures such as arrays for these tasks. As working examples, we are going to employ two problems which are relevant to various scientific fields in their simplified form, namely the scheduling problem and matrix-vector multiplication. Note that, as always, a deep understanding of the underlying problem is only optional, and each task can be regarded purely as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parallel computing\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard about parallel computing in popular discord or you may have attended the talk by yours truly during the opening ceremony when I discussed, albeit very briefly, the need for and ubiquitous presence of parallel computing in the sciences. Either way, here's the elevator pitch: Computing power is tightly tied to the number of operations that can be done per unit time intuitively enough, which in turn is directly proportional to the number of cycles a processing unit can run per second. This number is the frequency of the processor. When you see a CPU advertised to run at 2.4 GHz, it means it runs $2.4 \\times 10^{9} \\frac{\\text{cycles}}{s}$. It turns out that the achievable frequency is limited mainly by two factors, namely the size of the semiconductors on the chip and the generated heat, both physical constraints, whose limits have been approached in the last decades through the steady advancements in the microprocessor industry. What this means on the ground is that computing units cannot operate at much higher frequencies than those already achieved, at least according to our current understanding of these physical constraints, and you may have noticed that the frequency of the latest iteration of microprocessors have not dramatically changed over the previous years.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we achieve more computing capacity for our evermore power-hungry applications? The short answer is **parallel computing**. The main idea is to increase the number of processing units instead of increasing the base frequency of each processing unit. This idea is sometimes also referred to as *horizontal scaling*. Again, you may have noticed that the latest chips boast a higher *core* count compared to their previous-generation counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder if we are going to do any parallel computing here. Well, not really :( It would unfortunately be too intricate to start with that at this stage. Why am I telling you all this then? Although we won't be doing any parallel computing per se, we can address a standing problem in parallel computing! Namely **scheduling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Scheduling can broadly be defined as the problem of distributing a number of tasks between a number of workers, and is encountered in many areas, including but not limited to parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is relatively straightforward, nevertheless, carries tremendous weight, as the success and performance of the entire procedure hinges upon it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous scheduling solutions, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Here, we are going to limit ourselves to the most basic ones, namely static and dynamic scheduling, as described in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task revolves around implementing code that mimics the behavior of the scheduler in the parallel programming API. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Static scheduling is possibly the most straightforward algorithm for distributing a given number of tasks between a given number of processes. Given $n$ tasks and $m$ processes, static scheduling, in its simplest form, starts by assigning tasks $t_{i}, i = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$ to processes $p_{i}, i = 0, 1, \\dots, m-1$ as evenly as possible, as shown below, given three participating processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"figures/static_scheduling.png\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the scheduler starts assigning the first batch of tasks to the first process, the second batch of tasks to the second process, and so on, seeking to keep the batch size constant. It is important to note that the number of tasks $n$ must not necessarily be divisible by the number of processes $p$, i.e., there may be a remainder that is typically either assigned to the first or last process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to write a program that mimics the behavior of the static scheduler. We are going to make some simplifications here. In this first iteration, it suffices to print to the standard output that process $i$ is going to run task $j$ whenever it is assigned to it, e.g., \"Tasks j is assigned to Process i.\" It is assumed that a variable number of processes and tasks are given. You can assign the remainder of tasks to the last process in addition to its own share.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure that your program produces the expected behavior described above in terms of the distribution. Namely, every process should receive the same number of tasks with the exception of the last process, if necessary\n",
    "- You can use the indices $i$ and $j$ to identify processes and tasks and do not have to store them in an array\n",
    "- Think carefully about what you should loop over. Ask yourselves if you should loop over the tasks, the processes, or a combination thereof."

If the number of tasks exceeds the number of available processes, the scheduler starts from the first process again when it reaches the last process.\n",

    "\n",
    "In certain scenarios, e.g., when the computational intensity of tasks are inhomogeneous, static scheduling fails to provide the most efficient use of resources in general---Try to validate this for yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "In such cases, dynamic scheduling provides a more suitable scheduling technique, in which each worker is given one, or more generally, a chunk of task and the scheduler assigns the next task(s) to the first worker that becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the implementation of a dynamic scheduler, even an application that mimics its behavior requires some background functionalities that fall out of the scope of this exercise, I am going to set up some of it in the cell below; therefore, you can run it and safely ignore its content. Note that the number of tasks, number of processes and the chunk size are nevertheless defined here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we are going to assume that the chunk size is one in order to make things even simpler."

    "The more perceptive amongst you may already have anticipated what we are going to do next. To recap, we have created a couple of programs that target task scheduling. It was not important *how* the tasks were executed; however, we saw that, at least in principle, we could schedule tasks to be executed in a few different ways. On the other hand, we tackled, arguably, one of the most important operations in scientific computing, namely matrix-vector multiplication. We can now use the matrix-vector multiplication as the task for dynamic scheduling. In order to simplify the task even further, let us stay with square $n \\times n$ matrices. Your task is to write a program that generates $m$ random positive integers up to a maximum upper limit, where each number represents a matrix-vector multiplication task. More specifically, task $t_{i}, i = 0, \\dots, m - 1$ represents the computation of $b = \\mathbf{A}x$, where $\\mathbf{A}$ is a randomly initialized matrix of size $t_{i} \\times t_{i}$ and $x$ is a randomly initialized vector of size $t_{i}$."
